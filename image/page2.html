        <dd>Pakistan’s victory in the 2009 ICC T20 World Cup was a historic and emotional moment for the nation. The final was held on June 21, 2009, at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground in London, where Pakistan faced Sri Lanka. Bowling first, Pakistan’s bowlers delivered a stunning performance, restricting Sri Lanka to a modest total of 138 runs. Abdul Razzaq was particularly impressive, taking 3 vital wickets, while other bowlers kept the pressure on the Sri Lankan batsmen.  

            In the chase, Pakistan’s batting was led by the charismatic Shahid Afridi, who played a match-winning knock of 54* runs off 40 balls. His composed yet aggressive innings, coupled with Kamran Akmal’s quick start and Shoaib Malik’s steady support, ensured Pakistan reached the target with ease, winning by 8 wickets and with 8 balls to spare. Afridi’s all-round performance earned him the Player of the Match award.  
            
            This victory marked Pakistan’s first T20 World Cup title and came 17 years after their 1992 ODI World Cup triumph. It was a moment of immense pride and joy for a cricket-loving nation, providing a beacon of hope and unity during challenging times. The triumph remains a cherished memory in Pakistan’s cricket history.</dd>
